# 🏰 Idle Realms

A personal project to build a modern idle RPG game from scratch.

## 🎯 What is this?

Idle Realms is a browser-based idle RPG where players can progress through automated gameplay. Think of games like Cookie Clicker or Adventure Capitalist, but with RPG mechanics like character progression, equipment, and exploration.

## 🚀 Why am I building this?

This project serves multiple purposes for me:

- **Learning modern web development** - Experimenting with Go backend + SvelteKit frontend
- **Exploring game mechanics** - Understanding how idle games create engaging progression loops
- **Building something fun** - Creating a game I'd actually want to play
- **Portfolio project** - Demonstrating full-stack development skills

## 🛠️ Current Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (planning)
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (planning)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (planning)
- **Development**: Bun, TypeScript, Docker

## 📈 Current Status

Just getting started! Currently setting up the development environment and project structure.
